# 👋 Hi, I'm Krishanth

I build things that are fast, efficient, and sometimes unnecessarily optimized (in a good way). From custom memory allocators to quadtree-based image processors, I'm all about understanding how systems work under the hood—then making them better. Currently exploring performance optimization, systems programming, and building tools that solve real problems.
